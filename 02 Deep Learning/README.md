# Projects
**02 Evaluation:** Contains files used for evaluating the deep learning based methods. The trained models are unavailable as the files are too large for GitHub.<br/> 
**Create-CSV-dataset:** Used for creating targets to train keras-retinanet based models. <br/>
**RetinaNet_Rotated_Comb:** Refered to as RotinaNet in the report. <br/>
**RetinaNet_with_Angle:**  <br/>
**keras-retinanet-vanilla:** Copy of the original keras-retinanet https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet <br/>
